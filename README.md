## Spring 2025

## General Information

This is the repository for the Final assignment . In this assignment, I critiqued and offered suggestions for a statistical results statement, recreated a data visualization representing monthly average sea surface temperatures, created a generalized linear model for data about Swift Parrot nest box occupancy, and reflected on the affective visualization I made for my personal data collection.
